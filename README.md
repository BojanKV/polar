# Personal knowledge repository

Public repository for permanent storage and access of good-enough links and texts to keep track of

## How to use

- Download [Polar bookshelf](https://getpolarized.io/download.html)
- Install [Polar bookshelf](https://getpolarized.io/)
- Checkout this repo
- Copy [.polar](https://github.com/BojanKV/polar/tree/master/.polar) directory to (for now) default location.
  In linux, it is under: ```~/.polar```

- To add new updates to git, copy `~/.polar` directory to local git repo location and commit changes

## TODO

- Have git repo tracking directly linked to original polar location, or set polar to use git repo location by default
